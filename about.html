  <h1>About EcoEcho</h1>
  <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>
  <p>We all know the power of social media activism</p>
  <h4>BUT</h4>
  <p>Did you know that fossil fuel companies have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to spread false and misleading content about climate change on social media?</p>
  <p>Or that 16 of the world's biggest polluters were responsible for placing more than 1,700 of these ads on Facebook in 2021? Collectively, those ads garnered roughly 150 million impressions and have earned nearly $5 million for the platform.</p>

  <p class="txt"> This is a problem because many people therefore don't turst social media, thinking it is over sensationalied with algorithsm only promting false, negative content and sometimes even disinformation</br></br>However, our team believes this is overrepresented, with the data suggesting we should not downplay the ability of social media algorithms to help promote climate action. We hope to inspire future Greta Thunbergs and youth climate activists to leverage this powerful tool to promote climate action instead of being bogged down by negative belief that social media merely perpetuates negative group think</p>
